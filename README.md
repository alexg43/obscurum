**Work in Progress**

The build scripts may not work anymore, the project has been moved to Maven and is being periodically updated. Desperately needs a refactor.

**Old Instructions**

To compile and run the program, run the "run_obscurum" script by typing:
    ./run_obscurum
in the terminal.

To pack the program as a jar, run the "make_jar" script by typing:
    ./make_jar
in the terminal.

To run the jar, type:
    java -jar Obscurum.jar
in the terminal. Note that when running the jar, there should be a "resource"
directory on the same level, which contains a "custom_tiles.csv" file.
